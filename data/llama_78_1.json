{"text":"HyDE Query Transform Download Data Example HyDE improves specific temporal queries Failure case 1 HyDE may mislead when query can be mis interpreted without context Failure case 2 HyDE may bias open ended queries Load documents build the VectorStoreIndex First we query without transformation The same query string is used for embedding lookup and also summarization Now we use HyDEQueryTransform to generate a hypothetical document and use it for embedding lookup In this example HyDE improves output quality significantly by hallucinating accurately what Paul Graham did after RISD see below and thus improving the embedding quality and final output Querying without transformation yields reasonable answer Querying without transformation yields a reasonable answer Querying with HyDEQueryTransform results in a more biased output Querying with HyDEQueryTransform results in nonsense In this example HyDE mis interprets Bel without document context see below resulting in a completely unrelated embedding string and poor retrieval outcome Getting Started Use Cases Understanding Optimizing Module Guides API Reference Community Contributing Changes  If you re opening this Notebook on colab you will probably need to install LlamaIndex After going to RISD Paul Graham continued to pursue his passion for painting and art He took classes in the painting department at the Accademia di Belli Arti in Florence and he also took the entrance exam for the school He also continued to work on his book On Lisp and he took on consulting work to make money At the school Paul Graham and the other students had an arrangement where the faculty wouldn t require the students to learn anything and in return the students wouldn t require the faculty to teach anything Paul Graham was one of the few students who actually painted the nude model that was provided while the rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they d seen in American art magazines The model turned out to live just down the street from Paul Graham and she made a living from a combination of modelling and making fakes for a local antique dealer After going to RISD Paul Graham worked as a consultant for Interleaf and then co founded Viaweb with Robert Morris They created a software that allowed users to build websites via the web and received 10 000 in seed funding from Idelle s husband Julian They gave Julian 10 of the company in return for the initial legal work and business advice Paul Graham had a negative net worth due to taxes he owed so the seed funding was necessary for him to live on They opened for business in January 1996 with 6 stores Paul Graham then left Yahoo after his options vested and went back to New York He resumed his old life but now he was rich He tried to paint but he didn t have much energy or ambition He eventually moved back to Cambridge and started working on a web app for making web apps He recruited Dan Giffin and two undergrads to help him but he eventually realized he didn t want to run a company and decided to build a subset of the project as an open source project He and Dan worked on a new dialect of Lisp which he called Arc in a house he bought in Cambridge The subset he built as an open source project was the new Lisp whose After graduating from the Rhode Island School of Design RISD in 1985 Paul Graham went on to pursue a career in computer programming He worked as a software developer for several companies including Viaweb which he co founded in 1995 Viaweb was eventually acquired by Yahoo in 1998 and Graham used the proceeds to become a venture capitalist He founded Y Combinator in 2005 a startup accelerator that has helped launch over 2 000 companies including Dropbox Airbnb and Reddit Graham has also written several books on programming and startups and he continues to be an active investor in the tech industry Bel is a programming language that was written in Arc by Paul Graham over the course of four years March 26 2015 to October 12 2019 It is based on John McCarthy s original Lisp but with additional features added It is a spec expressed as code and is meant to be a formal model of computation an alternative to the Turing machine Bel is the pseudonym of Paul Graham the author of the context information who was in need of seed funding to live on and was part of a deal that became the model for Y Combinator s Bel is an ancient Semitic god originating from the Middle East He is often associated with the sun and is sometimes referred to as the Lord of Heaven Bel is also known as the god of fertility abundance and prosperity He is often depicted as a bull or a man with a bull s head In some cultures Bel is seen as a creator god responsible for the creation of the universe He is also associated with the underworld and is sometimes seen as a god of death Bel is also associated with justice and is often seen as a protector of the innocent Bel is an important figure in many religions including Judaism Christianity and Islam The author would likely say that art and engineering are two different disciplines that require different skills and approaches Art is more focused on expression and creativity while engineering is more focused on problem solving and technical knowledge The author also suggests that art school does not always provide the same level of rigor as engineering school and that painting students are often encouraged to develop a signature style rather than learn the fundamentals of painting Furthermore the author would likely point out that engineering can provide more financial stability than art as evidenced by the author s own experience of needing seed funding to live on while launching a company The author would likely say that art is a more lasting and independent form of work than engineering They mention that software written today will be obsolete in a couple decades and that systems work does not last In contrast they note that paintings can last hundreds of years and that it is possible to make a living as an artist They also mention that as an artist you can be truly independent and don t need to have a boss or research funding Furthermore they note that art can be a source of income for people who may not have access to traditional forms of employment such as the model in the example who was able to make a living from modelling and making fakes for a local antique
