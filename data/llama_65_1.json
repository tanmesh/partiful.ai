{"text":"ReAct Agent with Query Engine RAG Tools Build Query Engine Tools Setup ReAct Agent Run Some Example Queries Compare gpt 3 5 turbo vs gpt 3 5 turbo instruct Taking a look at a turbo instruct agent Try more complex queries Getting Started Use Cases Understanding Optimizing Module Guides API Reference Community Contributing Changes  In this section we show how to setup an agent powered by the ReAct loop for financial analysis The agent has access to two tools one to query the 2021 Lyft 10 K and the other to query the 2021 Uber 10 K We try two different LLMs gpt 3 5 turbo gpt 3 5 turbo instruct Note that you can plug in any LLM that exposes a text completion endpoint Download Data Here we setup two ReAct agents one powered by standard gpt 3 5 turbo and the other powered by gpt 3 5 turbo instruct You can optionally specify context which will be added to the core ReAct system prompt We run some example queries using the agent showcasing some of the agent s abilities to do chain of thought reasoning and tool use to synthesize the right answer We also show queries Async execution Here we try another query with async execution We compare the performance of the two agents in being able to answer some complex queries We compare gpt 3 5 turbo with gpt 3 5 turbo instruct agents on more complex queries Observation The turbo instruct agent seems to do worse on agent reasoning compared to the regular turbo model Of course this is subject to further observation","link":"https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/react_agent_with_query_engine.html"}
