{"text":"Welcome to LlamaIndex Why Context Augmentation Why LlamaIndex for Context Augmentation Who is LlamaIndex for Getting Started Ecosystem Community Associated projects  Getting Started Use Cases Understanding Optimizing Module Guides API Reference Community Contributing Changes LlamaIndex is a data framework for LLM based applications which benefit from context augmentation Such LLM systems have been termed as RAG systems standing for Retrieval Augemented Generation LlamaIndex provides the essential abstractions to more easily ingest structure and access private or domain specific data in order to inject these safely and reliably into LLMs for more accurate text generation It s available in Python these docs and Typescript Tip Updating to LlamaIndex v0 10 0 Check out the migration guide LLMs offer a natural language interface between humans and data Widely available models come pre trained on huge amounts of publicly available data like Wikipedia mailing lists textbooks source code and more However while LLMs are trained on a great deal of data they are not trained on your data which may be private or specific to the problem you re trying to solve It s behind APIs in SQL databases or trapped in PDFs and slide decks You may choose to fine tune a LLM with your data but Training a LLM is expensive Due to the cost to train it s hard to update a LLM with latest information Observability is lacking When you ask a LLM a question it s not obvious how the LLM arrived at its answer Instead of fine tuning one can a context augmentation pattern called Retrieval Augmented Generation RAG to obtain more accurate text generation relevant to your specific data RAG involves the following high level steps Retrieve information from your data sources first Add it to your question as context and Ask the LLM to answer based on the enriched prompt In doing so RAG overcomes all three weaknesses of the fine tuning approach There s no training involved so it s cheap Data is fetched only when you ask for them so it s always up to date LlamaIndex can show you the retrieved documents so it s more trustworthy Firstly LlamaIndex imposes no restriction on how you use LLMs You can still use LLMs as auto complete chatbots semi autonomous agents and more see Use Cases on the left It only makes LLMs more relevant to you LlamaIndex provides the following tools to help you quickly standup production ready RAG systems Data connectors ingest your existing data from their native source and format These could be APIs PDFs SQL and much more Data indexes structure your data in intermediate representations that are easy and performant for LLMs to consume Engines provide natural language access to your data For example Query engines are powerful retrieval interfaces for knowledge augmented output Chat engines are conversational interfaces for multi message back and forth interactions with your data Data agents are LLM powered knowledge workers augmented by tools from simple helper functions to API integrations and more Application integrations tie LlamaIndex back into the rest of your ecosystem This could be LangChain Flask Docker ChatGPT or anything else LlamaIndex provides tools for beginners advanced users and everyone in between Our high level API allows beginner users to use LlamaIndex to ingest and query their data in 5 lines of code For more complex applications our lower level APIs allow advanced users to customize and extend any module data connectors indices retrievers query engines reranking modules to fit their needs To install the library pip install llama index We recommend starting at how to read these docs which will point you to the right place based on your experience level To download or contribute find LlamaIndex on Github https github com jerryjliu llama_index PyPi LlamaIndex https pypi org project llama index GPT Index duplicate https pypi org project gpt index Github https github com run llama LlamaIndexTS Docs https ts llamaindex ai LlamaIndex TS https www npmjs com package llamaindex Need help Have a feature suggestion Join the LlamaIndex community Twitter https twitter com llama_index Discord https discord gg dGcwcsnxhU LlamaHub https llamahub ai A large and growing collection of custom data connectors LlamaLab https github com run llama llama lab Ambitious projects built on top of LlamaIndex","link":"https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/"}
