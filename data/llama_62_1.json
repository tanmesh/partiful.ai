{"text":"Step wise Controllable Agents High Level Agent Architecture Notebook Walkthrough Test OpenAI Agent Test ReAct Agent Test E2E Chat Test Step Wise Execution List Out Tasks  Getting Started Use Cases Understanding Optimizing Module Guides API Reference Community Contributing Changes This notebook shows you how to use our brand new lower level agent API which supports a host of functionalities beyond simply executing a user query to help you create tasks iterate through steps and control the inputs for each step Our agents are composed of AgentRunner objects that interact with AgentWorkers AgentRunners are orchestrators that store state including conversational memory create and maintain tasks run steps through each task and offer the user facing high level interface for users to interact with AgentWorkers control the step wise execution of a Task Given an input step an agent worker is responsible for generating the next step They can be initialized with parameters and act upon state passed down from the Task TaskStep objects but do not inherently store state themselves The outer AgentRunner is responsible for calling an AgentWorker and collecting aggregating the results If you are building your own agent you will likely want to create your own AgentWorker See below for an example This notebook shows you how to run step wise execution and full execution with agents We show you how to do execution with OpenAIAgent function calling We show you how to do execution with ReActAgent There s two main ways to initialize the agent Option 1 Initialize OpenAIAgent This is a simple subclass of AgentRunner that bundles the OpenAIAgentWorker under the hood Option 2 Initialize AgentRunner with OpenAIAgentWorker Here you import the modules and compose your own agent NOTE The old OpenAIAgent can still be imported via from llama_index agent import OldOpenAIAgent Here we re demonstrate the end to end execution of a user task through the chat function This will iterate step wise until the agent is done with the current task Now let s show the lower level API in action We do the same thing but break this down into steps We do the same experiments but with ReAct There are 3 tasks corresponding to the three runs above","link":"https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/agent_runner/agent_runner.html"}
