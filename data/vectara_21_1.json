into Vectara s GenAI platform using the Airbyte destination connector  January 17 2024 by Ofer Mendelevitch When building a GenAI or semantic search application with Vectara one of the most important considerations is how to architect your data ingestion pipeline that transfers data from your systems into Vectara in a way that scales well is robust to system failures and provides a mechanism for incremental updates We recently added a Vectara destination connector to Airbyte s list of destination connectors which makes this process quick and easy In this blog post we will review this new Vectara connector explain how to set up an ETL flow from one of Airbyte s source connectors and provide an end to end example for ingesting text from documents in a Google Drive into Vectara using Airbyte Vectara offers powerful generative AI capabilities for developers via an easy to use API Often referred to as RAG in a box Vectara s platform simplifies the development of GenAI applications by taking care of the heavy lifting required for building RAG retrieval augmented generation applications document chunking embedding vector storage state of the art retrieval and summarization are all handled behind the scenes and in a scalable and secure fashion When building a GenAI application there are two main data flows Vectara s API provides native support for indexing text and uploading files however it is often up to the user to take care of the details In particular the application developer is required to build the code that would crawl the source data convert it into text and ingest it into Vectara using the API With the complexity of data sources in the enterprise this can easily become more complex than originally anticipated and hard to maintain over time Furthermore as the source data updates the developer needs to ensure incremental updates are performed properly Enter Airbyte an open source tool for data movement with 350 connectors designed specifically to help address the data ingestion problem Besides offering a large breadth of connectors for APIs and databases that work out of the box Airbyte solves common data integration problems like incremental syncs schema evolution and sync observability in a single place in a consistent manner for all your data integration needs Using Airbyte s capabilities for data movement at scale using the Vectara destination connector makes it easier for GenAI developers to build scalable enterprise grade GenAI applications with immediate access to a growing list of data connectors to deal with various enterprise needs Google Drive is pretty ubiquitous although other competing solutions like Microsoft s OneDrive Box com and Dropbox are also pretty good and especially for those using Google Suite it s common to have all your documents hosted there But how many times did you want to find that document you know exists in your Google Drive but you just can t remember where it is Or maybe you want to ask a question and have a response based on all the relevant documents hosted on your Google Drive I know I have So let s build an example of a GenAI application that allows you to do just that using Airbyte to index your Google Drive into Vectara and build a question answering application using that data Our first step would be to sign up for an account on Vectara if you don t already have one You can create a corpus for your application but the Vectara connector also includes the capability to generate this target corpus for you and all you need is a corpus name Note that the Vectara destination adds a special metadata field to the Vectara corpus called _ab_stream which is used internally in the ingest flow Vectara s free account can include up to 50MB of text extracted from your Google Drive documents If you need to index larger amounts of text you can add a credit card to increase your Vectara account data quota to the size you need or contact sales for the Vectara Scale plan For this blog post I ll use a publicly available Google Drive folder that includes seven of William Shakespeare texts However in order to simulate a real life situation where the folder is private I ve made a copy of it to my local Google Drive folder under the name shakespeare To install Airbyte on an EC2 instance we follow the instructions in this guide Usually we would need to follow this step by step guide to set up the right permissions for the Google Drive folder to ensure we have the right credentials set up allowing the Google Drive source connector to work properly To setup the connection we go to the main Airbyte dashboard screen at localhost 8000  Now let s set up the connection between our Google Drive and Vectara following these 3 simple steps That s it Once you finish configuring the connection and it s enabled Airbyte will automatically sync the contents of the source Google folder with Vectara Airbyte will make sure your Vectara corpus stays in sync with your source data with minimal overhead and notify you in case the data replication can t be completed Now all the content of these seven wonderful works of Shakespeare are ingested into Vectara let s do some querying In Vectara s Console the query tab can be use to run some sample queries Let s try Who is Juliet  Or we can ask Who is King Lear to get the following  Of course you can use Vectara s query API to run your own queries and integrate them into your GenAI App Or use the vectara answer tool to build a full functional question answering application In this blog post we ve seen the power of using Airbyte s powerful data movement platform together with Vectara s trusted platform to build GenAI applications We ve provided an example for moving data from Google Drive to Vectara but of course many other data sources are available via Airbyte such as Salesforce Airtable Asana BigQuery or Elastic just to name a few For more complex setups it can make sense to first move raw data into a warehouse to perform transformations before eventually loading them into Vectara this post about ELTP architectures goes into greater detail of such a setup We encourage you to try this new exciting integration with your own data and let us know how it works we re always excited to hear about your GenAI projects And as always if you have any questions please feel free to join the Vectara Discord server or Airbyte s Slack and let us know Ofer Mendelevitch leads developer relations at Vectara He has extensive hands on experience in machine learning data science and big data systems across multiple industries and has focused on developing products using la","link":"https://vectara.com/blog/vectara-and-airbyte/"}
