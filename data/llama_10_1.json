{"text":"Query Transformations Use Cases HyDE Hypothetical Document Embeddings Multi Step Query Transformations   Getting Started Use Cases Understanding Optimizing Module Guides API Reference Community Contributing Changes LlamaIndex allows you to perform query transformations over your index structures Query transformations are modules that will convert a query into another query They can be single step as in the transformation is run once before the query is executed against an index They can also be multi step as in The query is transformed executed against an index The response is retrieved Subsequent queries are transformed executed in a sequential fashion We list some of our query transformations in more detail below Query transformations have multiple use cases Transforming an initial query into a form that can be more easily embedded e g HyDE Transforming an initial query into a subquestion that can be more easily answered from the data single step query decomposition Breaking an initial query into multiple subquestions that can be more easily answered on their own multi step query decomposition HyDE is a technique where given a natural language query a hypothetical document answer is generated first This hypothetical document is then used for embedding lookup rather than the raw query To use HyDE an example code snippet is shown below Check out our example notebook for a full walkthrough Multi step query transformations are a generalization on top of existing single step query transformation approaches Given an initial complex query the query is transformed and executed against an index The response is retrieved from the query Given the response along with prior responses and the query follow up questions may be asked against the index as well This technique allows a query to be run against a single knowledge source until that query has satisfied all questions An example image is shown below  Here s a corresponding example code snippet Check out our example notebook for a full walkthrough Examples","link":"https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/optimizing/advanced_retrieval/query_transformations.html"}
