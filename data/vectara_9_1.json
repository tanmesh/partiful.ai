Standard Indexing REST Endpoint Index Request and Response Index Document Request and Response Document Format Section within a Document Custom Dimensions Use Cases Scale only  The first step in using Vectara is to index a set of relateddocuments or content into a corpus Indexing a document enables you to makedata available for search and retrieval more efficiently The StandardIndexing API is recommended for applications where documents already have aclear and consistent structure Our Standard Indexing capability transforms this structured data into aformat that enables the data to become easily searchable in just a fewseconds We also support a variety of data formats by allowing you to specifymultiple document attributes and metadata The request that adds data into a corpus provides essential information aboutthe document you want to index A document is a piece of coherent textualmatter This index request requires the following parameters The response includes a status message and a StorageQuota messageindicating how much quota was consumed An ALREADY_EXISTS status codeindicates how much quota would have been consumed The storage quota object returns the number of characters consumed and thenumber of metadata characters consumed The total quota consumed is simply thesum of both values A document object encapsulates the information about the data that you wantto index A document in Vectara is very flexible because it represent ashort tweet or book with thousands of pages This object has a document_idwhich must be unique among all the documents in the same corpus The documentmay optionally speciify a title description and metadata The core ofthe document is also structured in sections that can include uniqueidentifiers titles strings metadata and so on The custom_dims field provides default values for the correspondingsection fields should they fail to define them explicitly Most importantly section defines the actual textual matter A section represents an organizational subunit within a document Itsdefinition is recursive since a section can be composed of further sections The actual textual content which is at least a single sentence but might spanseveral paragraphs or more is stored in text Like a document it mayoptionally specify a title which semantically corresponds to a sectionheader or chapter title Sections provide flexibility and it s possible that a section specifies atitle but relegates the text to subsections For instance consider thefollowing simple document excerpt from Wikipedia Settled by successive waves of arrivals during at least the last 13 000years 41 California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverseareas in pre Columbian North America Various estimates of the native populationrange from 100 000 to 300 000 42 The indigenous peoples of California includedmore than 70 distinct ethnic groups of Native Americans ranging from large settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior Californiagroups also were diverse in their political organization with bands tribes villages and on the resource rich coasts large chiefdoms such as the Chumash Pomo and Salinan Trade intermarriage and military alliances fostered manysocial and economic relationships among the diverse groups The first Europeans to explore the California coast were the members of aSpanish sailing expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodr guez Cabrillo they entered San Diego Bay on September 28 1542 and reached at least as farnorth as San Miguel Island Privateer and explorer Francis Drake exploredand claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579 landing northof the future city of San Francisco The first Asians to set foot on whatwould be the United States occurred in 1587 when Filipino sailors arrived inSpanish ships at Morro Bay Sebasti n Vizca no explored andmapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain sailing as far north asCape Mendocino This could be represented as a top level section titled History and no text It would contain two sections First inhabitants and Spanish rule that bothspecify text The part metadata held in metadata_json is returned in search queryresults It can contain for example information that links the item to recordsin other systems Finally custom_dims allows you to specify additional factors that can beused at query time to control the ranking of results The dimensions must bedefined ahead of time for the corpus or else they ll be ignored The request body provides essential information about the document you want toindex The Index request requires the following parameters The response from the server includes a status code and the amount of quotaconsumed You can find the full Standard Indexing gRPC definition at indexing proto The reply does not block The information in the request is not necessarilyavailable in the index when the RPC returns In most cases it becomesavailable within a second Here is an example response Custom dimensions are a powerful Vectara capability Customdimensions enable you to attach numeric factors to every item in the index which affect its final ranking during searches Some example use cases include Define the authoritativeness of the content For example content with 100upvotes can be ranked higher than content with no upvotes and 10 downvotes Indicate the source of the content If there are N sources this is usually done by defining N customdimensions and treating them as boolean 0 1 fields This allows weighting results based on source or even excluding certainsources altogether For example content from a government FAQ would be ratedhigher than content from a user forum Define the geography in which content is relevant Indicate the publication date which makes it easy to weight more recentresults higher For more information on how to use custom dimensions refer to theCustom Dimensions Usage
