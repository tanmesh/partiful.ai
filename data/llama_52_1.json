{"text":"LLM Pydantic Program Extract into Album class Define a Custom Output Parser Initialize with Pydantic Output Parser  Getting Started Use Cases Understanding Optimizing Module Guides API Reference Community Contributing Changes  This guide shows you how to generate structured data with our LLMTextCompletionProgram Given an LLM as well as an output Pydantic class generate a structured Pydantic object In terms of the target object you can choose to directly specify output_cls or specify a PydanticOutputParser or any other BaseOutputParser that generates a Pydantic object in the examples below we show you different ways of extracting into the Album object which can contain a list of Song objects This is a simple example of parsing an output into an Album schema which can contain multiple songs Just pass Album into the output_cls property on initialization of the LLMTextCompletionProgram If you re opening this Notebook on colab you will probably need to install LlamaIndex Define output schema Define LLM pydantic program Run program to get structured output The output is a valid Pydantic object that we can then use to call functions APIs The above is equivalent to defining a Pydantic output parser and passing that in instead of the output_cls directly Sometimes you may want to parse an output your own way into a JSON object","link":"https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/output_parsing/llm_program.html"}
