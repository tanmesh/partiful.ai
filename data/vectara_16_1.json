Customers who interact with the products via the user interface must authenticate before accessing non public customer data We make HTTPS encryption also referred to as SSL or TLS available on every one of its login interfaces and for free for every customer Our HTTPS implementation uses industry standard algorithms and certificates We store user passwords using well validated technical approaches and policies that follow industry standard practices for security We have implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest Authorization Customer Data is stored in multi tenant storage systems accessible to Customers via only application user interfaces and application programming interfaces Customers are not allowed direct access to the underlying application infrastructure The authorization model in each of our products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned individuals can access relevant features views and configuration options Authorization to data sets is performed through validating the user s permissions against the attributes associated with each data set Application Programming Interface API access Public product APIs may be accessed using an API key or through other secure access methods Role based access control Vectara allows you to assign role specific access and permission to user entities in Vectara products
