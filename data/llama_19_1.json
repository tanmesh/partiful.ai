{"text":"Router Retriever Setup Download Data Load Data Define Selector Module for Routing PydanticSingleSelector PydanticMultiSelector  Getting Started Use Cases Understanding Optimizing Module Guides API Reference Community Contributing Changes  In this guide we define a custom router retriever that selects one or more candidate retrievers in order to execute a given query The router BaseSelector module uses the LLM to dynamically make decisions on which underlying retrieval tools to use This can be helpful to select one out of a diverse range of data sources This can also be helpful to aggregate retrieval results across a variety of data sources if a multi selector module is used This notebook is very similar to the RouterQueryEngine notebook If you re opening this Notebook on colab you will probably need to install LlamaIndex We first show how to convert a Document into a set of Nodes and insert into a DocumentStore There are several selectors available each with some distinct attributes The LLM selectors use the LLM to output a JSON that is parsed and the corresponding indexes are queried The Pydantic selectors currently only supported by gpt 4 0613 and gpt 3 5 turbo 0613 the default use the OpenAI Function Call API to produce pydantic selection objects rather than parsing raw JSON Here we use PydanticSingleSelector PydanticMultiSelector but you can use the LLM equivalents as well Node ID 7d07d325 489e 4157 a745 270e2066a643Similarity NoneText What I Worked On February 2021 Before college the two main things I worked on outside of schoo Node ID
